        Hello! I'm your TU Berlin canteen assistant. I can help you with:

        - Show menus for Hardenbergstrasse, Marchstrasse, or Vegan Mensa
        - Filter by dietary needs (vegan, vegetarian, nut-free)
        - Find meals within your budget
        - Suggest main dish + side combinations

        Which canteen would you like to check? (You can also say "canteen 1", "canteen 2", or "canteen 3")

        Which category would you like to see?
        Alternatively, you can say suggest a meal for a specific price (e.g., "meal for 5 euros") or ask for dietary options (e.g., "vegan options").

        I'm not sure I understood. Here's what I can do:
        - Show canteen menus (e.g., "menu for Hardenbergstrasse")
        - Filter by diet (e.g., "vegan options")
        - Check prices (e.g., "what's under 3 euros?")
        - Suggest meals (e.g., "meal for 5 euros")

        What would you like?
